            <h2>Life?</h2>
            <p>
                Life is different for every human being. Do you think you'll understand the pain of a mother that has to wonder what she'll provide to her children. Do you think you'll ever understand the resolve of a mother that is constantly being punished by life and she has no choice but to endure it. Do you understand of seeing your mother console herself because her man chose something else over her?
                DO you understand the traumatizing it is to watch your father being the biggest ashole to ever live. I hate man, I hate man like him. I love him as an enemy, not as a father. Imagine not having a father present and when you do you would rather wish they'd never meet again. Imagine watching your mother getting old, yet as suffering just increases. Imagine having a impulsive father that is more like cancer than a father to the family.

            <h2>Faith?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes: I have faith that this all will end soon or later if we strive to come out of this pithole and we walk in link with God, I don't think there's anything that can go against us and actually win. They might win battles, but not the war. God help me keep my head straight, help me become the best version of myself. Yes: I am in hurry, but teach me to be patient be consistent with my work, helo me work faster and become the best version of myself, help me take my mother of the physical suffering and You take care of the spiritual suffering. Please! don't allow her to die without You and to die without seeing us succeed. That's all she wants to see.
