            <h1>Thoughts of a carnal man</h1>
            <h2>What I hate about the world</h2>
            <p>
                I belive I hate everything about the world, not the people (though they can get in my nerves sometimes) but their evil deeds.
            </p>
            <h2>The world changes from bad to worse</h2>
            <p>
                The world has never change to better since the 'fall' and it will never change to something good because we are govern by satan. Luckly 
                Jesus came for rescue and gave the ones that are looking for a change to find salvation. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Christianity has salvation
            </h2>
            <p>
                That's becaue Jesus is the saviour of us all and Christianity is all based in Him. Other religions have superficial ideas of reality of the world and salvation and damnation, Christ saves and all of them that accept this truth and believe it with they heart will be saved. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                The Devil holds much power
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you play with the devil, you'll certainly die and go to hell. This shouldn't even be a discussion, it's just facts that fire burns and unless you have an armor prepare yourself to get hurt. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Conclusion
            </h2>
            <p>
                I just wanted to write random stuff and I decided to talk about Jesus because I like to talk about Jesus, but I should try to talk about Him with other as well.
